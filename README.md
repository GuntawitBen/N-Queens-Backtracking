## N-Queens Solver - Java Implementation
This project provides a solution to the classic N-Queens problem using backtracking developed part as a group project of EGCI221 Data Structures and Algorithm course.  
The application allows users to manually place the first queen on the board and then solves the remaining queens using the backtracking algorithm. It also provides an option for automatically solving the N-Queens puzzle for any valid board size (>= 4).

### Features
Manual Queen Placement: Users can manually place the first queen on the board.  
Backtracking Algorithm: The program solves the N-Queens puzzle using a backtracking approach.  
Flexible Board Size: Users can specify the board size (minimum size is 4).  
Retry or Exit: After solving the puzzle, users can choose to restart the game or exit the program.  

### Technologies Used
Language: Java  
Algorithm: Backtracking  
Input: User input via console  
Output: Display of the chessboard and solutions on the console  

### Usage
1. The program will prompt you to enter the board size (>= 4).
2. You can choose to manually place the first queen on the board or let the algorithm place all queens automatically.
3. If you manually place the first queen, you will be prompted to enter its row and column coordinates.
4. After the board is solved, you can choose to either retry or exit the program.
